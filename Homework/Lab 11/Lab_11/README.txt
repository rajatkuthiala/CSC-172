Good introduction to Scheme. I wasnâ€™t sure whether to include the code that he put on the lab so I did not because that would just be copying and pasting. To create the GCD function in Scheme, I used a java version first than tried to convert that to the Scheme language. I had trouble with usage of if but using cond worked better.
